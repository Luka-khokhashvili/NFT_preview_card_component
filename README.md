## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- HTML5 classes
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- :root color variables
- Mobile responsive design

### What I learned

I tested and acknowledged my skills in web-development, also found what i had problems with and worked to fix them. I mostly admire that i become better in building responsive designs and useing flexbox as a powerfull tool.

Those are code sections i am proud of doing

```html
<img
  class="main-nft-image"
  src="./images/image-equilibrium.jpg"
  alt="Equilibrium, Equilibrium_NFT, main-image"
/>
```
```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 400px) {
  .main-container {
    width: 87.2%;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I would love to and will focus on developing more skills and growing my knowledge in building better styled website, useing more fluent and stable css and smoother responsive design for every kind of device screens
